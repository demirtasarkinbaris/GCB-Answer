## 1.1 
Proving Event Emission: Yes, you can prove that a particular event with specific arguments has been emitted in the past within the transaction runtime. One general concept to achieve this is to maintain a mapping of event hashes to boolean values. Whenever an event is emitted, you can calculate its hash and set the corresponding boolean value in the mapping to true. Later, during the transaction runtime, you can check this mapping to verify if the event has been emitted before with the desired arguments.

```solidity
contract EventProver {
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) public eventHashes;
    event MyEvent(address indexed _sender, uint256 _value);

  
    function emitAndStoreEvent(uint256 _value) public {
        emit MyEvent(msg.sender, _value);
        bytes32 eventHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _value));
        eventHashes[eventHash] = true;
    }
  
    function proveEventEmitted(address _sender, uint256 _value) public view returns (bool)
        bytes32 eventHashToProve = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_sender, _value));
        return eventHashes[eventHashToProve];
    }
}
```


## 1.2 
Verifying Contract Deployment and Bytecode: Yes, you can verify if there is a contract deployed at a specific Ethereum address with a specific bytecode within the Ethereum transaction context. One common approach is to use the extcodesize opcode, which returns the size of the code at a given address. By comparing this size with the expected bytecode size of the trusted contract, you can verify the presence of the contract. Additionally, you can also hash the bytecode and compare it with a precomputed hash to ensure it matches the expected source code.

```solidity
contract Example {
    function checkContract(address _addr) external view returns (bool) {
        uint256 size;
        assembly {
            size := extcodesize(_addr)
        }
        return size > 0;
    }
}
```



## 1.3 
Returning Struct Data Structure from External Contract's Function: Yes, another contract's function can return a struct data structure. However, direct return of structs across contracts is not possible in Solidity. Instead, you have several options:

Restructure the data: You can split the struct into individual variables and return them separately. Then, you can reconstruct the struct in the calling contract.

```solidity
contract StructReturner {
    struct MyStruct {
        uint256 intValue;
        address addrValue;
    }

    function getStructValues() public view returns (uint256, address) {
        MyStruct memory myStruct = MyStruct(42, address(0x123));
        return (myStruct.intValue, myStruct.addrValue);
    }
}
```

Use library contracts: You can define a library contract containing the struct definition and functions to operate on it. Then, both the caller and callee contracts can import and use this library to handle the struct.
```solidity
library StructLibrary {
    struct MyStruct {
        uint256 intValue;
        address addrValue;
    }
}

contract StructReturner {
    using StructLibrary for StructLibrary.MyStruct;

    function getStructValues() public view returns (uint256, address) {
        StructLibrary.MyStruct memory myStruct = StructLibrary.MyStruct(42, address(0x123));
        return (myStruct.intValue, myStruct.addrValue);
    }
}
```

Use ABI encoding/decoding: You can encode the struct data into a byte array using ABI encoding in the callee contract and return it as a byte array. Then, decode the byte array back into the struct in the calling contract using ABI decoding.
```solidity
contract StructReturner {
    struct MyStruct {
        uint256 intValue;
        address addrValue;
    }

    function encodeStruct() public view returns (bytes memory) {
        MyStruct memory myStruct = MyStruct(42, address(0x123));
        return abi.encode(myStruct.intValue, myStruct.addrValue);
    }

    function decodeStruct(bytes memory data) public view returns (uint256, address) {
        (uint256 intValue, address addrValue) = abi.decode(data, (uint256, address));
        return (intValue, addrValue);
    }
}
```
